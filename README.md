# angular-2-seed
This is a seed repo for working with Angular2 Alpha; this code is stable and can be used to try things.

As of 4/28/2015, the code in the currently Angular2 repo does not seem to function correctly:

1. @Template has supposedly been replaced with @View, but @View does not work and throws an error
2. I cannot inject services into a component, by using "injectibles" or "componentServices"
